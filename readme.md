We decided to formalize the following tasks:

### Small tasks
- task 1: Formalization of the catalan numbers (in `Basic/catalan.lean`)
- task 2: Formalization of the concept of plane trees (in `Basic/trees.lean`)
- task 3: Formalization of the concept of full binary trees (in `Basic/trees.lean`)
- task 4: Construction of the type of full binary trees with n nodes, not counting the leaves (in `Basic/trees.lean`)
- task 5: Definition of the type of ballot sequences of length n (in `Basic/ballot.lean`)

### Larger tasks

- task 1 (in `task1.lean`)
- task 4 (in `task4.lean`)
- task 5 (in `task5.lean`)
- task 6 (in `task6.lean`)

### Example
Example code with calls of all the formalizations is avalible in `example.lean`.
